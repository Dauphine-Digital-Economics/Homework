I attended the **NFT Paris Week** exhibition, and what interested me the most was **PrimeSkill** (Twitter account: [@PrimeSkillX](https://twitter.com/PrimeSkillX)). They launched a lottery event with a **McLaren sports car** as the prize (**the purple McLaren in the picture**), creating a particularly lively atmosphere on-site.  

From my conversation with the staff, I learned that they are developing a **“Win-to-Earn” PvP gaming ecosystem** based on the **Solana blockchain**. Specifically, they aim to promote two games:  

- **FrontStrike** – A first-person shooter set in a near-future **World War III** scenario.  
- **Chess** – A blockchain-based version of the classic game.  

Both games are expected to launch in **2025**. The project’s goal is to enable players to **earn income through gaming skills**, with plans to introduce a native token, **$SKILL** (details yet to be announced), which will serve as a **reward and transaction medium** within the ecosystem. Additionally, PrimeSkill shares insights into the games’ **world-building** (such as *FrontStrike*’s fictional military factions and planned **DLC storylines**) and actively engages with the community.  

### PrimeSkill and Web3  
PrimeSkill is deeply tied to **Web3**, as it leverages **Solana blockchain technology** and emphasizes **decentralization** and **player ownership**. The decentralized nature of Web3 allows players to earn **$SKILL** tokens or other digital assets (*potentially including NFTs, such as in-game equipment or skins*) through **PvP victories**. These assets are **fully owned by players** and can be traded on-chain.  

Unlike traditional **"Pay-to-Win"** models, PrimeSkill's **“Win-to-Earn”** mechanism utilizes **Web3 blockchain technology**, combined with **Solana’s efficient transactions**, to create a **skill-driven, player-controlled economic ecosystem**.  

This is precisely its **direct connection to Web3**: through **blockchain and tokenomics**, it aims to **reshape revenue distribution and asset ownership in gaming**.
