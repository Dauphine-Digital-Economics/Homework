EXERCISE 1：Market Research of the Space Industry




Introduction

The space industry has undergone a profound transformation in recent decades. Traditionally dominated by state-funded programs that prioritized reliability and high-cost components, the industry is now witnessing a shift towards cost-effectiveness and rapid deployment, driven by the rise of New Space. France, through its space agency CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales), has established itself as the dominant player in Europe, integrating space advancements into its national defense strategy. By contrast, Germany’s DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) has focused more on scientific research and industrial collaborations. This paper examines France’s space strategy, contrasts it with Germany’s approach, explores how CNES secured its dominance, and analyzes the evolving trends in the New Space market, particularly regarding component supply chains. Finally, it assesses how manufacturers, distributors, and space agencies are adapting to these changes and provides a perspective on the future of the space industry.





France’s Space Strategy and CNES

France’s space strategy has been defined by its long-standing commitment to national sovereignty, technological leadership, and military applications. Unlike many European nations, which have relied on multinational collaborations, France pursued an independent path from the outset. The establishment of CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales) in 1961 under President Charles de Gaulle was a strategic move to ensure the country’s autonomy in space activities. The French government recognized early on that space technology would be crucial not only for scientific and commercial purposes but also for national security. This led to substantial government funding aimed at reducing reliance on American and Soviet technology.
Throughout the Cold War, France’s space ambitions were closely tied to its defense strategy. While other European countries focused on collaborative civilian projects, France invested heavily in military satellite programs. The Syracuse series provided secure military communications, while the Helios reconnaissance satellites strengthened France’s intelligence capabilities. By integrating space technology into its defense sector, France ensured a steady flow of funding and technical expertise, making CNES one of the most well-supported space agencies in Europe.
One of the defining aspects of France’s space strategy has been its focus on independent launch capabilities. Recognizing the geopolitical risks of relying on foreign rockets, CNES played a key role in developing the Ariane program, which became Europe’s primary launch system. The first Ariane rocket was launched in 1979, marking the beginning of a successful commercial spaceflight program. Over the following decades, France maintained leadership in this sector, securing lucrative contracts for launching satellites while ensuring European strategic independence. In 2023, France remained the largest financial contributor to the European Space Agency (ESA), accounting for 27% of ESA’s total budget. This dominance allowed CNES to influence European space policy, directing investment toward projects that aligned with French industrial and strategic priorities.
Beyond launch vehicles, France has played a crucial role in several high-profile European space projects. It has been a leading force behind Galileo, the European alternative to GPS, and has contributed significantly to Copernicus, a large-scale Earth observation program. In planetary exploration, CNES has collaborated with NASA on missions such as VERITAS, which aims to study Venus. The country has also continued to expand its military space capabilities with projects like Syracuse IV, a next-generation secure satellite system designed to enhance defense communications.
To sustain its leadership, the French government has continued to invest heavily in aerospace and defense. In 2023, a €15 billion ($16 billion) investment plan was announced to support satellite production, next-generation rockets, and space defense programs. This level of investment, coupled with strategic partnerships with companies like Airbus and Thales Alenia Space, has reinforced France’s position as the dominant space power in Europe.





Germany’s Space Strategy and DLR

Germany’s space strategy has followed a markedly different path, prioritizing scientific research, industrial innovation, and international collaboration. Unlike France, Germany did not seek independent access to space but instead integrated itself into broader European and global space initiatives. The Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) was established in 1969, focusing on aeronautics, energy, and space exploration. While it has played a crucial role in European space science, Germany has never developed a national launch vehicle program, instead relying on ESA partnerships for space access.
Germany’s approach to space has been shaped by its post-World War II geopolitical constraints, which initially limited its ability to engage in military space programs. As a result, DLR concentrated on civilian applications, including Earth observation, robotics, and advanced satellite systems. Environmental monitoring became a key priority, leading to projects such as TerraSAR-X, a high-resolution radar imaging satellite, and EnMAP, which studies ecosystems and climate change. These initiatives aligned with Germany’s broader environmental policies, making space technology an integral part of its scientific research efforts.
Beyond Earth observation, Germany has been at the forefront of space robotics and artificial intelligence. DLR has developed advanced robotic systems for planetary exploration, including contributions to NASA’s Mars missions and the ExoMars rover, a collaboration with ESA and Roscosmos. Unlike France, which prioritizes defense applications, Germany has focused on how space technology can be integrated with its industrial expertise. One key area of innovation has been the adaptation of automotive-grade electronics for space applications. German companies like Bosch and Infineon have leveraged their experience in automotive semiconductors to develop high-performance space components, bridging the gap between traditional aerospace electronics and commercial off-the-shelf solutions.
In terms of funding and influence within ESA, Germany ranks as the second-largest contributor, providing 21% of the agency’s budget. This significant investment has ensured that Germany remains a central player in European space projects, particularly in satellite-based services and next-generation space technologies. However, its reluctance to develop an independent launch capability has made it more dependent on European and international collaborations.
Germany’s current space strategy continues to emphasize cooperation. It has been a leading partner in the Copernicus Earth observation program and has played a crucial role in the Galileo navigation system, particularly in the development of high-precision signal processing. The country has also contributed to NASA’s Orion spacecraft, providing key components for the European Service Module, which will support future deep-space missions.
Despite its strengths in research and industrial applications, Germany’s space strategy has faced limitations due to its lack of sovereign launch capabilities and its lower investment in military applications compared to France. While its approach has fostered strong European partnerships, it has restricted Germany’s ability to unilaterally shape space policy in the way that France has been able to do.
Comparison and Strategic Differences
France and Germany have taken fundamentally different approaches to space policy, reflecting their distinct historical, economic, and strategic priorities. France has maintained a sovereignty-driven model, emphasizing military applications, independent launch capabilities, and strong state support for its aerospace sector. In contrast, Germany has adopted a collaborative and research-focused approach, prioritizing scientific exploration, Earth observation, and industrial innovation.
One of the key factors behind France’s dominance in the European space sector is its long-term investment in launch vehicles. The Ariane program has given France a unique position as Europe’s primary launch provider, reducing reliance on American and Russian rockets. Germany, by contrast, has never pursued an independent launch system and instead relies on ESA for access to space. This strategic choice has reinforced France’s leadership in space policy, allowing it to shape ESA priorities while benefiting economically from launch contracts.
Another major distinction lies in their approach to defense applications. France has seamlessly integrated space technology into its national security strategy, developing a network of military satellites for reconnaissance, secure communications, and early warning systems. Germany, constrained by its post-war defense policies, has largely avoided military space projects, focusing instead on environmental monitoring and scientific research. This has resulted in a space sector that is highly specialized but less versatile than France’s defense-oriented model.
At the industrial level, both countries have leveraged their national strengths to advance space technology. France has built a world-class aerospace industry through partnerships with companies like Airbus, Arianespace, and Thales Alenia Space, ensuring that its space sector remains competitive. Germany, on the other hand, has applied its expertise in automotive-grade electronics, robotics, and AI to space applications, creating synergies between its space and industrial sectors.
While France’s space strategy has made it the dominant player in Europe, Germany’s research-driven approach has positioned it as a leader in satellite technology and space robotics. Moving forward, the two countries are likely to maintain their respective strategic priorities, with France continuing to push for sovereign capabilities and military applications, while Germany strengthens its role in European scientific and industrial collaborations.






How CNES/France Achieved Dominance

France’s dominance in the European space industry is the result of a combination of strategic government support, early investment in independent launch capabilities, strong defense integration, and industrial leadership. Unlike other European nations that relied on collaborative approaches, France took deliberate steps to ensure its autonomy in space activities, leveraging both political and economic instruments to establish a robust and self-sufficient space sector.
A key pillar of France’s space leadership has been its commitment to independent launch capability, a vision set in motion with the Ariane program in the 1970s. Recognizing the geopolitical and economic risks of depending on foreign launch providers, France spearheaded the development of Ariane as Europe’s primary launch vehicle, ensuring sovereign access to space. The establishment of Arianespace in 1980 marked a turning point, allowing Europe to compete in the global commercial satellite launch market. For decades, Ariane rockets dominated global commercial launches, peaking at over 50% market share in the 1990s before increasing competition from SpaceX eroded its lead. Nevertheless, continued investments in the Ariane 6 program demonstrate France’s determination to maintain its strategic advantage.
Beyond launch vehicles, France’s government has played an essential role in fostering a vertically integrated space industry. Through CNES, the government has channeled substantial funding into research, development, and industrial collaborations. Unlike Germany, which has favored a decentralized and science-driven approach, France has concentrated funding in key areas to maximize industrial competitiveness. Government subsidies and regulatory policies have incentivized domestic production of spacecraft components, reducing dependence on foreign suppliers. This strategy has positioned French aerospace companies—such as Airbus, Thales Alenia Space, and Safran—as global leaders in satellite manufacturing and space infrastructure.
The integration of space technology into France’s national defense strategy has been another significant factor in CNES’s dominance. The French military has long been a major stakeholder in space projects, ensuring stable funding and strategic relevance for CNES programs. The development of secure military satellite communications (Syracuse), reconnaissance systems (Helios), and early-warning satellite networks has strengthened France’s defense posture while reinforcing its technological capabilities. The decision to incorporate space assets into national security planning has provided long-term stability for France’s aerospace industry, shielding it from the budget fluctuations that often impact purely commercial space initiatives.
While prioritizing sovereignty, France has also been highly active in international collaborations, balancing independence with strategic partnerships. As the largest contributor to ESA (27% of total funding in 2023), France has shaped European space policy to align with its national interests. It has played a leadership role in major ESA projects, such as Galileo (Europe’s global navigation system) and Copernicus (Earth observation program). Beyond Europe, France has engaged in bilateral space partnerships with key allies, including NASA, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and Japan’s JAXA, expanding its influence in global space affairs.
Another major factor behind CNES’s sustained leadership is its ability to balance commercial and governmental priorities. Unlike some space agencies that focus predominantly on either national security or commercial projects, CNES has successfully managed both sectors simultaneously. It has supported a thriving commercial space industry, offering launch services and satellite solutions to international clients, while continuing to prioritize government-led strategic initiatives. This hybrid approach has ensured economic sustainability, enabling France to weather challenges such as budgetary constraints and shifting geopolitical landscapes.
In addition, France has maintained a strong regulatory framework and long-term industrial planning to support its space sector. The French government has been proactive in setting policies that encourage private-sector participation while maintaining strategic oversight. This has allowed France to integrate emerging trends like New Space into its industrial strategy, ensuring that its aerospace firms remain competitive in a rapidly evolving global market.






Key characteristics of the New Space market include:

The New Space market represents a transformative shift in the space industry, driven by the need for cost efficiency, faster development cycles, and greater accessibility to space. Unlike traditional space programs, which have been dominated by government-funded agencies focusing on highly reliable and extensively tested components, New Space companies prioritize commercial viability, scalability, and innovation. Several defining characteristics set the New Space market apart from its predecessors, each emerging as a response to specific industry challenges and economic incentives.

1. Increased Commercialization
The space industry is no longer solely the domain of government agencies like NASA, ESA, and Roscosmos. Private companies—led by SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and smaller satellite manufacturers—are reshaping the market by introducing cost-competitive and commercially driven solutions.
This trend has been fueled by declining launch costs and advances in reusable rocket technology, allowing companies to operate without heavy government subsidies. SpaceX, for instance, reduced the cost of satellite launches by nearly 90% compared to traditional providers through the development of reusable Falcon 9 rockets. This shift has encouraged private sector investment, leading to a growing number of commercial players offering satellite manufacturing, data services, and even space tourism.
Governments have also embraced public-private partnerships as a means of reducing their own financial burden while fostering innovation. Programs like NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and ESA’s initiatives with European startups illustrate how public institutions are outsourcing certain space functions to private companies, further accelerating commercialization.

2. The Rise of Smaller Satellites and Mega-Constellations
The growing reliance on small satellites and large-scale constellations has fundamentally changed how space missions are planned and executed. Traditional satellites, often weighing several tons and costing hundreds of millions of dollars, are increasingly being replaced by small, low-cost satellites that can be launched in large numbers.
Companies like SpaceX (Starlink), OneWeb, and Amazon (Project Kuiper) are deploying mega-constellations, consisting of thousands of small satellites, to provide global internet coverage. These constellations have become feasible due to miniaturization of electronics, lower launch costs, and advancements in modular satellite design.
The shift towards smaller satellites is driven by several factors:
Faster Deployment Cycles: Unlike traditional satellites that take years to develop, small satellites can be built and launched in months.
Redundancy and Scalability: Instead of relying on a few large satellites with long lifespans, companies can deploy hundreds of smaller satellites, replacing failed ones quickly without mission failure.
Lower Costs: Manufacturing and launching small satellites cost significantly less, making space accessible to new players, including universities and developing countries.
This shift challenges legacy aerospace manufacturers, who must now adapt to a market where mass production, not custom-built systems, defines success.

3. Flexible and Rapid Manufacturing
Unlike traditional aerospace programs, which rely on custom-designed, low-volume production, New Space companies prioritize high-volume, modular manufacturing. This approach reduces development costs and lead times, allowing for rapid iterations and deployment.
One major factor enabling this shift is additive manufacturing (3D printing), which allows companies to produce spacecraft components faster and with fewer raw materials. Companies like Rocket Lab manufacture entire rocket engines using 3D printing, drastically cutting production time. Similarly, satellite makers are integrating standardized designs to facilitate mass production, mirroring practices used in the automotive and electronics industries.
This transition to a more flexible production model allows companies to respond quickly to market demands. For example, relatively inexpensive and rapidly deployable satellites enable companies to test and refine new technologies in orbit rather than spending years developing a single, highly engineered system.

4. The Shift Toward Non-Traditional Supply Chains
Traditional space programs have relied on high-reliability (HiRel) components, which undergo extensive testing and qualification to withstand extreme radiation, temperature variations, and long-duration missions. These components are highly specialized and manufactured in small quantities, making them expensive and time-consuming to procure.
New Space companies, in contrast, are adopting commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which are widely available and much cheaper. This shift is driven by three main factors:
Cost Reduction: HiRel components can be 10 to 100 times more expensive than equivalent commercial-grade electronics. Using COTS components drastically cuts costs.
Faster Procurement: Traditional space components require years of testing, while COTS parts can be sourced immediately from existing commercial supply chains.
Reliability Through Redundancy: Instead of relying on a single ultra-reliable system, New Space companies use multiple redundant systems to compensate for failures. This approach is particularly evident in satellite constellations, where failed satellites can be easily replaced without compromising the overall mission.
However, the adoption of COTS components presents new challenges, particularly in radiation resistance and long-term reliability. To address these concerns, space agencies and manufacturers are developing hybrid approaches, using radiation-tolerant versions of commercial components. ESA, for instance, introduced the ECSS-Q-ST-60-13C standard, which outlines testing methods for qualifying COTS electronics for space use.





Challenges and Opportunities in the New Space Era

The New Space model, with its emphasis on cost efficiency, rapid development, and commercial viability, has ushered in a new era of space exploration. However, these advantages also come with significant operational, regulatory, and strategic challenges. Governments, private companies, and international organizations must now navigate a rapidly evolving landscape where technological breakthroughs often outpace existing policies and risk mitigation strategies.

Regulatory and Legal Challenges
One of the most pressing concerns in the New Space era is space debris management. The rapid increase in satellite constellations, particularly from companies like SpaceX (Starlink), OneWeb, and Amazon (Project Kuiper), has led to overcrowding in low Earth orbit (LEO). The proliferation of thousands of small satellites increases the risk of collisions, fragmentation, and cascading debris events, a scenario known as Kessler Syndrome, where uncontrolled debris makes certain orbits unusable.
To address these risks, space agencies and regulatory bodies have begun introducing stricter deorbiting and collision-avoidance policies. For instance, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now requires satellites in LEO to deorbit within five years of mission completion, significantly shorter than the previous 25-year guideline. Similarly, the European Space Agency (ESA) is working on active debris removal technologies, including the ClearSpace-1 mission, which aims to develop methods for removing defunct satellites from orbit.
Beyond debris management, spectrum allocation and orbital slot congestion are becoming contentious issues. The increasing number of commercial satellites has intensified competition for radio frequencies and orbital positions, leading to disputes between governments and private companies. Regulatory frameworks must evolve to ensure fair access to space resources while minimizing interference between satellite networks.

National Security and Geopolitical Risks
As commercial space technology becomes more advanced and widely accessible, national security concerns have emerged. Governments worry that high-resolution imaging, global broadband networks, and real-time tracking technologies—once the exclusive domain of military and intelligence agencies—are now available to private entities and potentially hostile nations.
For example, Starlink’s secure and decentralized satellite internet has been a game-changer in modern conflicts, notably supporting Ukraine’s communications during the Russia-Ukraine war. This development has led other nations to accelerate their own sovereign satellite networks, with China launching its GuoWang constellation as a state-backed alternative to Starlink. These trends suggest that commercial space assets will increasingly be viewed as strategic national infrastructure, potentially subject to governmental oversight, cybersecurity regulations, or even countermeasures in the event of geopolitical tensions.
Opportunities for Economic Growth and Technological Advancement
Despite these challenges, New Space has opened unprecedented opportunities for economic expansion and innovation. The global space economy, currently valued at over $450 billion, is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2040, driven largely by commercial ventures.
One of the most significant benefits of New Space is the democratization of space access. In the past, space missions were the exclusive domain of a handful of well-funded governments. Today, thanks to low-cost launch vehicles and standardized small satellites, universities, startups, and even developing nations can participate in space exploration. Earth observation, remote sensing, and satellite-based services are being used in agriculture, disaster management, climate monitoring, and urban planning, expanding the commercial applications of space technology beyond traditional aerospace sectors.
Additionally, the rapid development cycles associated with New Space are fostering technology spillovers in adjacent industries. Advanced AI, automation, robotics, and 3D printing techniques, originally developed for space applications, are now being integrated into manufacturing, healthcare, and energy sectors. This cross-industry collaboration accelerates technological progress, creating a broader impact beyond the space industry itself.
While traditional aerospace companies and space agencies must adapt to a more commercially driven environment, the shift also presents new business models. Companies that successfully bridge the gap between traditional HiRel components and the New Space COTS supply chain will be best positioned to thrive in this new era.





Comparing Traditional HiRel Supply Chains with New Space Supply Chains

The shift from traditional space missions to the New Space paradigm has fundamentally altered the structure and priorities of space supply chains. Historically, space missions prioritized high-reliability (HiRel) components, which were rigorously tested to ensure performance in extreme space environments. These components were custom-built for each mission, resulting in long development timelines and high costs.
In contrast, New Space companies have adopted commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, significantly reducing costs and production time. Instead of focusing on extreme reliability at the component level, New Space operators prioritize system-level redundancy and software-driven fault tolerance.
Key Differences Between Traditional and New Space Supply Chains
Traditional space supply chains have been characterized by:
Rigorous Qualification Standards: Components undergo years of testing for radiation resistance, vacuum conditions, and thermal cycling, ensuring mission-critical reliability.
Low-Volume, High-Cost Production: HiRel components are manufactured in limited quantities, making them expensive and slow to procure.
Strict Supplier Control: Only a few specialized suppliers can produce ESA- or NASA-approved components, limiting supply chain flexibility.
By contrast, New Space supply chains focus on:
COTS Components: New Space firms leverage commercially available electronics, modifying them only minimally for space applications.
Redundancy-Based Reliability: Instead of building ultra-reliable components, systems use multiple backups to mitigate failures dynamically.
Rapid Procurement and Scalability: High-volume, commercial-grade production reduces costs and shortens development timelines.
Flexible Standards: ESA’s ECSS-Q-ST-60-13C framework is a notable example of how agencies are adapting qualification standards to accommodate New Space’s cost-driven model.
This shift has led to a divergence in supply chain priorities, forcing traditional aerospace manufacturers to rethink their role. Many are now offering hybrid solutions, combining COTS efficiency with improved radiation tolerance, ensuring that New Space companies can operate in more demanding orbital environments.





Adaptation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Space Agencies

The rapid transformation of space supply chains has required manufacturers, distributors, and space agencies to rethink their traditional business models.
Manufacturers like Infineon and STMicroelectronics have responded by developing radiation-hardened versions of COTS components, ensuring they remain relevant in the New Space market while still catering to HiRel customers.
ESA and CNES have also modified their qualification processes to accommodate commercial components. Instead of requiring full HiRel certification, space agencies now allow batch testing, probabilistic risk assessments, and software-driven fault tolerance as alternative methods of ensuring reliability.
Another emerging solution is blockchain technology, which is being explored for tracking component provenance and quality assurance in decentralized supply chains. Given the global nature of space manufacturing, blockchain-based tracking systems could provide greater transparency, security, and efficiency.






Future Outlook of the Space Industry

The future of the space industry is expected to be shaped by cross-industry collaboration, regulatory evolution, and hybrid supply chain models.
One major trend is the increased collaboration between the space and automotive industries. The growing use of automotive-grade semiconductors and sensor technologies in space applications highlights how advancements in commercial industries can be repurposed for orbital use. This shift is reducing costs and increasing accessibility while encouraging new players to enter the space market.
Additionally, the introduction of stricter space debris regulations is likely to impact future satellite design. Governments and space agencies may impose deorbiting requirements, mandatory propulsion systems for maneuverability, or licensing restrictions for large constellations, affecting how companies operate in LEO.
While concerns remain about the reliability of COTS components in deep-space missions, hybrid models that balance cost-efficiency with HiRel principles are likely to define the industry’s next phase.





Conclusion

The space industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation with the rise of New Space, challenging traditional supply chain models, regulatory frameworks, and mission architectures. CNES has successfully maintained its leadership through strategic investments, sovereign capabilities, and commercial adaptability, while New Space has introduced a paradigm shift in how satellites are built, launched, and operated.
As commercial and government entities compete and collaborate in this new era, the balance between cost-efficiency and reliability will determine the industry’s long-term trajectory. Whether through new regulatory policies, cross-sector technology adoption, or hybrid space supply chains, the future of space exploration will likely be defined by a combination of innovation, adaptability, and strategic foresight.
